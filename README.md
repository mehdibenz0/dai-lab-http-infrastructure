Optional Step 1: Management UI (Using Portainer)
Why Portainer?
In this project, I've opted to enhance the management and monitoring of the web infrastructure using Portainer. Portainer is a user-friendly and powerful container management tool that provides a convenient web interface for Docker. It simplifies Docker container orchestration and makes it easier to visualize, manage, and update containers.

To access it go to http://localhost:9000.

Once you've accessed Portainer, you gain a powerful interface for managing the Docker containers. The dashboard offers a comprehensive overview of the containers, networks, and volumes, providing insights into the web infrastructure.

Navigate to the "Containers" section to view and manage the running containers.

Starting/Stopping Containers:

Start or stop containers with a simple click on the respective container in the Portainer interface.
